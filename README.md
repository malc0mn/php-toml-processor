TOML parser and builder for PHP
===============================

**This is very much WIP.** Do not use in production, maybe don't even call it a TOML parser just yet ;-)

## Install using composer

Open a shell, `cd` to your poject and type:

```sh
composer require malc0mn/php-toml-processor dev-master
```

or edit composer.json and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "malc0mn/php-toml-processor": "~1.0"
    }
}
```
